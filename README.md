Pretalx-Halfnarp
==========================

Pretalx-Halfnarp is a Plugin that helps you to estimate the interest in your submissions and plan
room-sizes accordingly by scheduling the most requested submissions into the larger rooms.

It presents a Voting-Interface to visitors, where they can pick their most favourite submissions.
All submissions in the "Accepted" and "Confirmed" state are shown, so that you can use Halfnarp
before beginning to plan your schedule. The order of the submissions is randomized per viewer to
avoid a bias towards the top results.

Halfnarp is an anagram of Fahrplan, a not-yet sorted Fahrplan
